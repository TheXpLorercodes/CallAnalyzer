I've created a comprehensive Call Quality Analyzer optimized for Google Colab's free tier that will process your sales call in under 30 seconds. Here's what the system does:
ðŸŽ¯ Core Features

Talk-Time Ratio: Calculates speaking percentage for each participant
Question Counter: Uses regex patterns to identify and count questions
Longest Monologue: Finds continuous speech segments by speaker
Sentiment Analysis: Uses VADER sentiment analyzer for real-time processing
Actionable Insights: Generates specific coaching recommendations
Bonus: Identifies sales rep vs customer using speech patterns and keywords

âš¡ Colab Optimizations

Whisper "tiny" model: Fastest transcription while maintaining accuracy
Efficient audio processing: 16kHz mono, limited duration for memory constraints
Simple speaker diarization: Energy-based detection instead of heavy ML models
VADER sentiment: Lightweight, rule-based sentiment analysis
Smart cleanup: Removes temporary files to free memory
